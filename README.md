## About

This project uses standard ESPHome components to replace original Xiaomi firmware.
Missing features and known problems:
- child lock support
- filter status
- sound notifications
- motor spinning during startup

## How to use

### Compilation
 See ESPHome documentation about [packages](https://esphome.io/components/packages/), if you don't know how to use it.
 
Minimal working config:
```yaml
packages:
  main: 
    url: https://github.com/m5k10/esphome-xiaomi-compact-4
    files: 
      - xiaomi-compact-4.yaml

esphome:
  name: xiaomi-compact-4
  friendly_name: Xiaomi Compact 4

wifi:
  id: wifiClient
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password
```

### Flashing
The device contains an ESP32-WROOM-32D module on the main PCB.
1. To replace original firmware, you need to disassemble the device and connect serial adapter to the pins next to ESP32.
The pins are labeled so there should be no problem finding TX, RX, GND and GPIO0. 
To activate the bootloader mode, you need to short GPIO0 to the GND while powering up the device.
2. Backup your original firmware in case you need to restore it:
```shell
esptool --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 read_flash 0x00000 0x400000 backup_xiaomi_compact_4.bin
```
3. Write ESPHome firmware to the flash. You can use ESPHome dashboard for that. The other option is to use `esptool`:
```shell
esptool --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 write-flash 0x00000  my_firmware.bin
```
4. At this stage, ESPHome OTA updates should be functional.
